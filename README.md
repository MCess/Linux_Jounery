Why would a deep knowledge of links be valuable to a cloud architect?

	1.	Many cloud services, including AWS, run Linux-based systems as their foundation.
	2.	Server Management: Linux is dominant in servers; engineers need to configure, troubleshoot, and optimize it.
	3.	Command-Line Proficiency: Efficient scripting and task automation rely on Linux command-line skills.
	4.	Open-Source Flexibility: Understanding Linux allows engineers to customize and deploy diverse software in cloud solutions effectively.
	5.	Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

Enjoy!!!!
